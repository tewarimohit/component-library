            ">1) The Dawn of<span class="italic"> a Revolution </span></h1>

            <small>September 5, 2021</small>

            <p style="font-size: large;">Technology is something that makes our lives hassle free, entertaining,
                surprising, memorable and full of possibilities. This word possibility in itself is the key to a whole
                new universe of technologies, it's a kind of loop you can say. </p>
            <p style="font-size: large;">We are certain to this fact that we do not get technology in a day, it takes
                countless revolutionary intellectual minds working day in and day out in an organised way with their
                cumulative organised efforts. As a result, in this modern world computers set a perfect example to
                showcase what humankind is capable of.</p>

            <p style="font-size: larger;">It all began when i was a kid, fortnate enough of having early access to
                computer, for me the whole purpose of this Charles Babbage's refined complex but simple looking machine
                was to play games. </p>

            <p style="font-size: larger;">For the world a computer works in 3 simple steps - Firstly it takes input from
                the user in the form of raw data, secondly it processes that data and thirdly gives the user output in
                the form of information but for me.. na-aa...</p>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">
                The 3 simple steps were - Firstly press UPS and CPU to open it, secondly choose the installed game icon
                on the screen and thirdly double click the icon and play.

        <div class="container-centre">

            <p style="font-size: larger;">In school there was a temple called Computer Lab where every class used to
                enter in a line after putting their shoes out to to enter and get the glimpse of the
                divine computer as if this was the place to attain ''Nirvana - the ultimate state of bliss''.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: larger;"> At times two or three kids sharing the same screen with their bright faces
                and sparkling eyes used to start the computer as per the SOP instructed by the teachers.</p>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">The pressure at the moment used to be intense as that of launching a satellite
                by the Space Research Organisations like one mistake of pressing wrong button and
                every other finger will point towards you.</p>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">In that holy place i have seen bliss turning into misery when noises like that
                of crowd surrounding the prime seller of a fish market, slight or intense odour
                of socks could be heard or sensed respectively due to unexpected power cut. But altogether it was fun
                during school days. </p>

            <p style="font-size: larger;"> Now when I look back at that kid playing games on that computer and compare
                it to today's self aspiring to create and develop websites, from working in a school's computer lab to
                work in the giant institutions of IT world. I realise how the technology is capable of <span
